# Car-Price prediction project

## Problem statement

Suppose that we have a website where people can sell and buy used cars. When posting
an ad on our website, the sellers often struggle to come up with a meaningful price. We want
to help our users with automatic price recommendation. We ask the sellers to specify model,
make, year, mileage, and other important characteristics of a car, and based on that
information, we want to suggest the best price.
